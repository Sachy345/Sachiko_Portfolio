```

## Overview

This is the second portion of the Coursera Statistical Inference course project. We will analyze the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package to determine if the Vitmain C has an effect on tooth growth in guinea pigs.

## 1) Loading ToothGrowth dataset and performing basic exploratory data analyis

```{r}
library(datasets)
data("ToothGrowth")
str(ToothGrowth)
```

Need to convert dose variable

```{r}
ToothGrowth$dose <- as.factor(ToothGrowth$dose)
str(ToothGrowth)

hist(ToothGrowth$len, freq = FALSE, ylim = c(0.00, 0.06))

curve(dnorm(x, mean = mean(ToothGrowth$len), 
            sd = sd(ToothGrowth$len)), add = TRUE, col = "blue")
```

## 2) Basic summary of ToothGrowth dataset

```{r, out.width="90%"}
summary(ToothGrowth)

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(x = supp, y = len)) +
    geom_boxplot(aes()) +
    labs(title = "Tooth Length v. Dose Amount", 
         x = "Supplement Type", y = "Tooth Length")

ggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(x = dose, y = len)) +
    geom_boxplot(aes()) +
    labs(title = "Tooth Length v. Supplement Type", 
         x = "Dose Amount", y = "Tooth Length")
```

## 3) Using Confidence Interval and T-Test to compare tooth growth by supp and dose

It appears the dataset is fairly normal. With this smaller dataset, we'll be using T-Test to test if delivery method and/or dose amount affects tooth growth

### Hypothesis 1: Vitamin C and Orange Juice result in same tooth growth

```{r}
t.test(len ~ supp, paired = FALSE, var.equal = TRUE, data = ToothGrowth)
```

The 95% confidence interval includes 0 and the p-value is greater than 0.05 therefore we fail to reject the null hypothesis that vitamin C and orange juice result in the same amount of tooth growth.

### Hypothesis 2: Increasing dose amount results in same tooth growth

```{r}
TGdose05_1 <- subset(ToothGrowth, dose %in% c(0.5, 1))
TGdose1_2 <- subset(ToothGrowth, dose %in% c(1, 2))
TGdose2_05 <- subset(ToothGrowth, dose %in% c(2, 0.5))

#95% Confidence Intervals
rbind(t.test(len ~ dose, paired = FALSE, var.equal = TRUE, data = TGdose05_1)$conf,
      t.test(len ~ dose, paired = FALSE, var.equal = TRUE, data = TGdose1_2)$conf,
      t.test(len ~ dose, paired = FALSE, var.equal = TRUE, data = TGdose2_05)$conf)

#P-Values
rbind(t.test(len ~ dose, paired = FALSE, var.equal = TRUE, data = TGdose05_1)$p.value,
      t.test(len ~ dose, paired = FALSE, var.equal = TRUE, data = TGdose1_2)$p.value,
      t.test(len ~ dose, paired = FALSE, var.equal = TRUE, data = TGdose2_05)$p.value)
```

All three 95% confidence intervals do not contain 0 and all three P-Values are essentially 0 therefore we reject the null hypothesis that increasing the dosage will result in the same amount of tooth growth.

## 4) Conclusion

Working with the assumptions that the data is iid normal and variance is equal we can conclude that the supplement delivery (vitamin C or orange juice) has no affect on tooth growth. However, increasing dosage amount, regardless of delivery method, appears to result in increase tooth growth
